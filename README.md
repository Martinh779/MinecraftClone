# Minecraft Clone Project

## Overview
This is a personal project where I'm building a low-level Minecraft clone from scratch using C++ and OpenGL. The goal is to challenge myself, deepen my understanding of computer graphics, and explore the complexities of creating a voxel-based game. This project is completely free of external libraries, relying solely on raw OpenGL and C++ to handle everything from rendering to system architecture.

## Current Features
- **Basic Project Setup**: The core framework for the project is in place.
- **Block Rendering**: Blocks are rendered in a 3D space with basic lighting.
- **Free Camera**: Navigate and fly freely around the world for full exploration.
- **Chunk System**: Blocks are managed and rendered in chunks for efficient performance.

## Next Steps (To-Do)
- **Optimized Rendering**: Ensuring only visible blocks are rendered to improve performance.
- **Chunk loading**: save chunks to a file and load them when needed. This will allow for infinite world generation.
- **Block Interaction**: Implement block breaking and placing mechanics.
- **Merge chunks**: Merge adjacent chunks to reduce the number of draw calls.

## Why This Project?
I've always been intrigued by how complex graphics and simulation work behind the scenes in games. Taking on a project like this pushes me to understand computer graphics on a deeper level and challenges me to solve problems that many take for granted in game development.
